    ///   - percentWidth:  A percent of a fixed width for the resulting view. If it's is `nil`, the resulting view assumes this view’s sizing behavior.

    ///   - alignment:     The alignment of this view inside the resulting view. alignment applies if this view is smaller than the size given by the resulting frame.
